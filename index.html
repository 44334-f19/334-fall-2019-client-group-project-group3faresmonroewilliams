        <h2>WELCOME TO PARTI YORKIES OF THE GROVE!</h2>
        <p>We are a fun loving family that has a passion for finding these yorkies the perfect home! Here at Pari Yorkies of the Grove we take pride in rasing our pups and finding them the perfect home for them to learn and grow. These yorki's truly make the perfect best friend for any ages. Yorki's are a great size to take anywhere so you never have to leave home without them! All of our parents are registered with the AKC. Your Yorkie puppy will have it's registration papers, shot record, and will be current on their shots and wormings. Our puppies are fed only the highest quality puppy food on the market, and are given the best chews and treats. All of them are healthy, happy and range in size from three to six pounds as full-grown adults. <br><br>They are cute tiny dogs that are sweet and beautiful. They have sparkling eyes, black button nose and the pointed ears that can simply melt your heart. In addition to their charming appearance, they are very personable and energetic. Known for their wit and grace, these Parti Yorkies are great additions to your family. I will always be available to answer any questions or address any concerns you have regarding your new four-legged friend. Please browse our site for more information on Parti Yorkie pups, and reach out today for information on adoption! We are looking forward to meeting you and helping you take in a new furry addition to the family.
